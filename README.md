# Ibento - An Event Management Platform

This repository is opted into Hacktoberfest 2023. Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md if you want to contribute.

## Description:
The website aims to streamline the flow of permissions and requests for event organizing among students and authorities.

For version 1, we intend to create the platform for the following stakeholders:
1. Students - Should be able to apply for events and create clubs
2. Faculty in Charge - Should be able to partially approve of requests
3. Deans and Directors - Should have final say in the decision of the venue and timing
4. Admin - Should have total control over the organization structure

Currently, we are developing the frontend for each of these perspectives.
